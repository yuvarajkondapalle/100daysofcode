C++ Introduction

P.S: I prepared my notes and this GitHub repo from various sources like C++ complete reference and some YouTube videos

History of C++:
•	Developed by Bjarne Stroustrup of Bell Laboratories in the early 1980s as a extension of c language.
•	It was initially called c with classes and later renamed as C++.
•	It was developed for adding a feature of OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in C without significantly changing the C component.


Hello World Program
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include<iostream>
void main()
{
  cout<<"Hello, World!";
}

#include<iostream.h> includes the standard input output library functions. It provides cin and cout methods for reading from input and writing to output respectively.
void main() The main() function is the entry point of every program in C++ language. The void keyword specifies that it returns no value.
cout << "Welcome to C++ Programming." is used to print the data "Welcome to C++ Programming." on the console.
